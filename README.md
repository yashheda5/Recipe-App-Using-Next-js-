# Recipe Explorer

Welcome to the **Recipe Explorer!** This project is a web application built using **Next.js** for server-side rendering and dynamic routing, combined with **React** for a scalable, component-based architecture. The design leverages **Tailwind CSS** for modern, responsive styling, and **shadcn/ui** for a set of pre-built, customizable UI components that enhance the user interface and experience. Data is fetched dynamically from a public API ([https://dummyjson.com/recipes](https://dummyjson.com/recipes)) using asynchronous JavaScript, with skeleton loading components to improve the user experience during data fetches. Error handling ensures smooth navigation, even when pages or recipes are unavailable.
